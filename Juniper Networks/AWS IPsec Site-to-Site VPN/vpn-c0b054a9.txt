# Amazon Web Services
# Virtual Private Cloud
#
# AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of 
# a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned a VPN Connection Identifier
# and is associated with two other identifiers, namely the 
# Customer Gateway Identifier and the Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
#
# Your VPN Connection ID  		    : vpn-c0b054a9
# Your Virtual Private Gateway ID           : vgw-d30032ce
# Your Customer Gateway ID 		    : cgw-f21e2cef
#
# This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be 
# configured on your Customer Gateway.
